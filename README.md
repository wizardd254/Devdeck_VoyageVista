# VoyageVista : A Smart Travel Planner


## Brief Description
The project aims to develop an AI-driven Travel Suggestion application that utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze user preferences and historical data. The application generates personalized travel suggestions for users by factoring in various parameters like location, time of travel, budget, airport prom=ximity, etc. It employs scikit-learn for machine learning functionalities, pandas for data manipulation, and numpy for numerical operations.

Additionally, the application integrates natural language processing (NLP) to comprehend user queries effectively using a chatbot. Furthermore, the project encompasses web development aspects to provide users with an interactive and user-friendly interface for accessing and utilizing the application's functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- NumPy
- Sklearn
- NTLK
- HMTL
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Flask
- Express
- MongoDB

## Machine Learning
The aim of the project is to develop a sophisticated travel recommendation system that utilizes advanced technologies to assist users in planning their trips more effectively and efficiently. 

Key Objectives:

1. **Leverage Machine Learning:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and historical travel data. This involves understanding user behavior and preferences to provide personalized recommendations.
2. **Provide Travel Suggestions:** Generate customized travel destinations based on various factors such as preferred locations – zone -> state -> city, google reviews, type of activity, and duration of the trip. The application should suggest destinations, accommodations, and activities tailored to the user's preferences.
3. **Curate Best Destinations:** Use user feedback and historical data to curate a list of the best destinations. The system should consider factors such as user ratings, reviews, and popularity to recommend destinations that are likely to meet the user's expectations.
4. **Dynamic Recommendations:** Implement natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user queries and provide dynamic recommendations. The application should interpret user input, extract relevant information, and generate appropriate responses in natural language.
5. **Chatbot Functionality:** Implement a conversational interface using NLP to understand user queries, provide personalized recommendations, and assist users throughout their travel planning journey.

## Dependencies 
It relies on the following:

•	Python

•	Libraries used are Numpy , sklearn, pandas

## Natural Language Processing –
Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for queries in a chatbot involves processing and understanding natural language input from users to generate appropriate responses or take relevant actions. Here's a brief description of how NLP was used in our chatbot:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
2. **Entity Extraction**
3. **Sentiment Analysis** and 
4. **Response Generation**

Using NLP in chatbots enables them to understand and respond to user queries more effectively, providing more natural and engaging conversational experiences. NLP techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the usability and functionality of chatbots across various domains and applications


## Web Development
1. **Frontend Development:** The frontend of the webiste and chatbot involve designing the user interface (UI) that users interact with. This involved creating a visually appealing layout using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing UI elements such as text input fields, buttons, and chat interfaces, integrating interactive features to enhance user experience, such as animations and real-time updates.

2. **Backend Development:** The backend  handles processing user inputs, executing logic, and generating responses. This involved implementing server-side code using Python with Flask, Node.js managing user sessions and maintaining conversation context to provide seamless interactions, integrating with external APIs or databases to retrieve information or perform actions based on user requests, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to chatbot functionality.

3. **Integration with NLP Services:** Our chatbot leverages NLP services or libraries to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses. This integration involves connecting to NLP APIs processing user input through NLP models to extract intents, entities, and sentiments, utilizing NLP outputs to drive chatbot behavior and provide relevant and context-aware responses.

In summary, web development aspects of a functional website which takes prompts from a user regarding their preferences and chatbot involves building both frontend and backend components, integrating with NLP services, enabling real-time communication, and ensuring seamless deployment and hosting for user accessibility. These aspects collectively contribute to creating an effective and user-friendly chatbot experience on the web.

## Dependencies
The website depends on the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Flask
- Express
- MongoDB
